# Handraiser (Team 4)

An application that allows Boom.Camp students to "digitally" raise their hand to request assistance from a mentor. This makes it easier for Mentors to efficiently provide assistance and reduces the burden on students to keep requesting assistance if Mentors forget who is next in the queue.
